Create a file called main.tf.
Create a docker image resource and call it nginx_image.
Set the name of the image to nginx:latest.
Save and exit the file.

Initialize Terraform.
Plan the deploy and output a terraform plan called tf_image_plan.
Apply the plan using tf_image_plan.

Answer

1) Create main.tf file

terraform {
        required_providers {
        docker = {
                source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
                version = "2.12.0"
                }
        }
}

provider "docker" {
        host = "npipe:////.//pipe//docker_engine"
}

resource "docker_image" "nginx_image" {
        name = "nginx:latest"
}

Save this file.

2)terraform init

//Terraform has been successfully initialized!

3)terraform plan -out tf_image_plan

//Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_image.nginx_image will be created
  + resource "docker_image" "nginx_image" {
      + id     = (known after apply)
      + latest = (known after apply)
      + name   = "nginx:latest"
      + output = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

4) terraform apply tf_image_plan

//Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
